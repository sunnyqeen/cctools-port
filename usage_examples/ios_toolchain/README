PREREQUISITES:

See cctools/ld64 README + libssl-dev, git, bash and a jailbroken iOS device

USAGE:

Please ensure you have read and understood the Xcode license terms before
building this toolchain: https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/xcode.pdf.

./build.sh /path/to/sdk.tar.* <target cpu>

Target CPU should be one of armv6, armv7, armv7s and arm64.

This will build an iOS toolchain prefixed with
arm-apple-darwin11-*

You can then use arm-apple-darwin11-clang / arm apple-darwin11-clang++
to build your applications.

---

IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET can be used to target older iOS versions.

For example:

export IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=5.0

will target iOS 5.0.
